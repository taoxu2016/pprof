Thank you for your interest in improving `pprof`! We welcome all kinds of contributions—bug reports, feature requests, documentation fixes, and code changes.

When creating an issue, include:

## Developer documentation

-   To add a model, read the vignette "Adding a model to pprof" (`vignette("adding-a-model", package = "pprof")`).
-   To change pprof itself, read [`dev/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](../dev/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md): the map of the repository, the rule that pprof reproduces the statistical behavior of pprof 1.0.3, and the commands.
